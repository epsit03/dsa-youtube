# Data Structures & Algorithms

Hey everyone!ðŸ‘‹
<br>All the codes that I have discussed or used in my videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPAoQJvS6BBSihc3B1bt7FA">```YouTube```</a> related to DSA have been collected here.
<br>This is a one-stop repository for all the DSA codes that you may need.
<br>Even you can contribute to this repository by creating a PR.
<br>Or if you find any error/bug in any of my code, feel free to raise an issue.
<br>Thank you all and <i>keep coding</i>.
